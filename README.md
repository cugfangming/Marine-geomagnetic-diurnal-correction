# Marine-geomagnetic-diurnal-correction
This project uses Matlab, uses a one-dimensional seawater layered conductivity model, combined with finite difference and fast Fourier transform to realize the conversion calculation between magnetic field values at different depths in seawater
Now we are too busy to upload only part of the code
